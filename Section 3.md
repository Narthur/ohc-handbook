# Academic Information
## Introduction

> “True education means more than taking a certain course of study. It is broad. It includes the harmonious development of all the physical powers and the mental faculties. It teaches the love and fear of God, and is a preparation for the faithful discharge of all of life’s duties” (*Education*, 13).

## Suggested Course Load

Students pursuing a degree at OHC should complete 30-33 semester hours per year to finish their Associate program in two years or their Bachelor’s program in four.

It is recommended that ESL students take a lighter course load in their first semester at OHC in order to help them adjust to the language differences.

The Admissions Committee may require students to take Foundations of English and/or Foundations of Math classes.

## Transfer Credit

Credits toward a degree may be granted for satisfactory work completed at accredited, degree-granting institutions. The Registrar of OHC must approve all credits. An official transcript must be submitted for transfer of credits. Only courses in which a student has received a grade of C or better are accepted. A maximum of 70 semester hours can be accepted from the community college level for students pursuing a Bachelor’s degree.

## Academic Appeals Procedure

Students who feel they have been treated unfairly in regard to their academic programs are entitled to an appeal for an impartial review and reconsideration of their cases. Procedures to be followed are:

* Students should first go to their teacher to determine the basis of the grade.
* Submit to your instructor a precise, detailed letter of appeal. In your letter you should make reference to the course grading criteria. (Note: Grades higher than a “C” may not be disputed; unless it is demonstrated to have a significant effect on the final class grade.)
* Students who wish to make further appeal concerning a grade are responsible for demonstrating that the given grade does not reflect academic merit, or is a result of computational or clerical error.
* If a satisfactory decision has not been reached, the case may be presented to the OHC Academic Affairs Committee. Students will be invited to present their cases in writing. The decision of the committee is final.

## Challenge Exams

With the approval of the OHC Academic Affairs Committee, students may be allowed to take challenge exams for certain courses. Up to 6 hours of credit may be granted for exams. This is in addition to hours granted for challenging classes in the practical arts. Challenge exams may be taken under any of the following conditions:

* The student has already taken the course or similar courses at another institution. 
* The student maintains at least a 3.75 GPA.

To take challenge exams, a letter requesting the exam and stating the reason must be made to the Academic Affairs Committee. A minimum score of 70% is required to receive credit. The fee for taking a challenge exam is $50, and the recording fee for any credit granted is $35 per semester hour.

## College-Level Examination Program (CLEP)

Ouachita Hills College makes provision for knowledge gained in other than traditional college course work. In such cases OHC accepts credit based on the results of various CLEP exams. A score at the 50th percentile or above is required for acceptance at OHC. The transcript will show the credit granted, and the grade will be recorded as “P” (pass).

## Credit for Life Experience

Students who have satisfactorily completed at least 24 semester hours with Ouachita Hills College may apply for credit for life experience by submitting a portfolio, along with a nonrefundable portfolio evaluation fee. Students must prepare a portfolio in accordance with the criteria established in the Student Portfolio Manual, available in the registrar's office. The portfolio must show evidence of student learning which is relevant to academic goals and which is gained through experience over a reasonable period of time. Credits awarded for life experience are limited to a maximum of 24 semester hours for baccalaureate degrees and 12 semester hours for associate degrees. Credits granted based on a combination of portfolio and challenge examinations may not exceed 30 hours for baccalaureate degrees and 18 hours for associate degrees. Life experience credits will be recorded as “pass” credits. For more information, please contact the OHC Registrar. There is a Portfolio Assessment Fee of $50 and a recording fee (per hour awarded) of $35.

## Registration

Students are expected to register during the scheduled registration periods designated in the school calendar. Registration is complete only after they have finished all registration procedures and made financial arrangements in the Business Office. Students may not register in absentia or for another student. All students are required to participate in the orientation activities.

Late registration: Permission to register late must be obtained from the Academic Affairs Committee. Students failing to register during the scheduled registration periods will be charged a late registration fee of $50. The course load of a late registrant may be reduced according to the amount of class work missed. No student may register after two weeks of the semester have elapsed. Exceptions may be made for the intensive classes which have not begun prior to the late registration deadline.

## Grading System

OHC uses the semester system. Grade points are awarded for each class that has been passed. Grade points for a given class are the product of the grade, on a four-point scale as noted below, and the semester hours earned in the class. The key below will help interpret grade reports and evaluate grade-point average (GPA).

|A    |4.00 |C    |2.00 |I    |Incomplete
|A-   |3.67 |C-   |1.67 |W    |Withdrawal
|B+   |3.33 |D+   |1.33 |NC   |Non-credit
|B    |3.00 |D    |1.00 |P    |Pass
|B-   |2.67 |D-   |0.67 |AU   |Audit
|C+   |2.33 |F    |0.00

## Grade Requirements

Overall GPA: A GPA of at least 2.0 (C) is required.

Emphasis GPA: A GPA of at least 2.25 is required in all transfer credits, and in all credits earned at OHC that are counted towards an emphasis.

Minor GPA: A GPA of at least 2.0 is required in all transfer credits, and in all credits earned at OHC that are counted for a minor.

No course with a grade below C- may count toward an emphasis or a minor.

## Academic Probation

A student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.0 will be placed on academic probation. A student on academic probation will not be allowed to register late for the semester, but must be present at the registration time stated on the schedule (available online at www.ohc.org). While on probation the student will be allowed to enroll for no more than an additional 12 hours. When the student has completed the 12 hours and the cumulative grade point average is at 2.5 or above, academic probation will be removed. However, if the problem is not corrected within that period, dismissal procedures may be implemented. The Academic Affairs Committee may review individual cases to determine the action most appropriate to the student’s situation.

## Repeating a Course

All grade point averages for admission, academic standing, and graduation are calculated based on hours attempted, except that a student may repeat a course in which he or she has received a grade of D or F. In such cases, when calculating the grade point average, the hours and quality points earned on the second effort will be used.

A course in which a student has earned a C may be repeated only with permission of that department chair and the Academic Affairs Committee. Students who have earned a grade of D in a core, cognate, or area of emphasis class, must repeat the class. Or they may take another course in the same area with the consent of the major advisor. If a student takes a course and then repeats it, only the last grade earned will be used in calculating the GPA. Except as specified in certain course descriptions, students may not receive credit for a course more than once.

## Grade Change

A grade may be changed by the teacher during a 6-month period from the date the grade was issued. Grades are changed only to correct an error made in determining or recording the grade. If a student is not satisfied with the grade he received for a class, the student has 90 days to contest the grade. After that time the grade will be final.

## Honesty

Using the work of another student or allowing one’s work to be used by another student jeopardizes not only the teacher-student relationship but also the academic standing of the students involved. Lessons may be discussed with other students; tutors may help to guide a student’s work; and textbooks, encyclopedias, and other resource materials may be used for additional assistance; but the actual response must be the student’s own work.

Exams must be completed in the presence of an approved supervisor without the assistance of books, notes, devices, or outward help unless otherwise specified in the exam directions. The student should have no access to the exam either before or after it is taken. A student who gives information to another student to be used in a dishonest way is equally guilty of dishonesty. Any violation of this policy will be taken before the OHC Academic Affairs Committee for appropriate punitive action.

## Class Schedule

Although every effort is made to be accurate in listing course offerings, OHC reserves the right to make essential course changes, to discontinue any course for which an insufficient number of students register, or to change the semester in which a course is offered.

## Course Load Tiers

|Part-time |1-5 credit hours
|Half-time |6-11 credit hours
|Full-time |12-17 credit hours
|Overload* |18 or more credit hours

*Students wishing to take an overload of 18 hours or more must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 for the previous semester and obtain permission by petitioning the Academic Affairs Committee. This is normally granted only to students in their senior year.

## Academic Advising

Academic advisors assist students by helping them understand and meet academic requirements for a degree, but the students themselves are responsible for understanding and fulfilling the requirements. If requirements are not satisfied, the degree will be withheld pending adequate fulfillment. Thus, it is essential that students become familiar with all requirements and remain currently informed throughout their college career.

## Withdrawal from a Course

To make program changes, students must obtain the appropriate change of registration form in the library, obtain the necessary signatures indicating approval of the change (advisor, teacher, and registrar), and return the form to the Registrar’s Office.

The signed form will become effective on the date it is returned to the registrar. In order for the withdrawal to be official this process must be completed by the last published date allowing withdrawal from a class. (Refer to the academic calendar for this date). Grades for unofficial course withdrawals will be recorded as an F on the academic transcript.

There are two withdrawal deadlines on the academic calendar:

* The first withdrawal deadline is for withdrawing from a class with a full refund. 
* The second deadline is for withdrawing from the class without the withdrawal being recorded on the student’s transcript. 

When a student drops a class before the first deadline stated on the academic calendar, the class is deleted off the student’s record. A grade of “W” is issued when a student drops the class after the second deadline specified on the academic calendar. The grade for any withdrawal after the final withdrawal deadline will automatically be “F.”

Due to course scheduling challenges OHC is unable to offer all courses every year. Therefore students should be aware that dropping a course could add significant length to their degree program.

## Grade Reports

Grade reports are given to students at the end of each semester. Students should check their grade reports carefully. If a student believes any part of the report is incorrect, he or she has three months to appeal. Appeals should be made first to the instructor, and then, as necessary, to the Academic Affairs Committee. Only the end-of-semester grades are recorded on the permanent grade transcript. Semester grade reports will only be released to students who have regular admission status.

## Incomplete Grades

An incomplete grade, recorded as an “I”, indicates the student was unable to complete class work because of illness or other unavoidable circumstances. Grades of “I” are not given because the class work was unsatisfactory or because the student simply neglected to complete scheduled assignments. When an “I” is received, the work necessary to complete the class must be finished by the date specified on the academic calendar. If the makeup work is of such a nature that additional time is required, the student must seek approval of the instructor and request permission from the Academic Affairs Committee (forms for this request may be obtained in the Registrar’s Office). An incomplete grade will become an F if the class work is not finished in the prescribed time.

## Concurrent Enrollment

Any course taken at another institution while a student is enrolled at OHC (by correspondence or through summer school, as examples) must have prior approval of the registrar if the student would be certain that the credits will aid him in fulfilling OHC degree requirements.

## Auditing

In some instances, a student may want to audit a course. If space is available, the student may attend the class and listen to the lectures and discussions. No exams, quizzes, papers, or projects will be required of an auditing student except at the discretion of the teacher. No credit is given. No change from credit to audit may be made after the last day to withdraw from a course.

Some courses may be audited only at the full tuition rate. Where a course has enrollment limits, students taking the course for credit will be given priority. Auditing students must understand the instructor is under no obligation to evaluate their work and/or performance. Audits may be recorded on transcripts. Proficiency exams may not be taken after a course is audited.

## Study Load

One semester hour equals fifteen 50-minute class periods per semester (Three clock hours of laboratory work is equivalent to one 50-minute class period). For each semester hour of academic work earned, a student may be expected to spend up to two hours per class period in outside preparation.

## Classification of Students

Class standing is determined at the beginning of each semester as follows:

|Freshmen   |0–23 hours completed
|Sophomores |24–55 hours completed
|Juniors    |56–89 hours completed
|Seniors    |90+ hours completed

## Double Major

Although students are encouraged to seek a broad educational experience at OHC, approval to earn a double major is not automatic. In some cases, receiving a double major may require actually earning two degrees (See Concurrent Bachelor’s Degree below). Because the requirements of some majors are complex, students wishing to pursue more than one major should investigate major degree requirements early in their career at OHC. To pursue a double major, written application must be filed with the Registrar’s Office.

## Concurrent Bachelor’s Degrees

An OHC student who wishes to pursue two bachelor’s degrees concurrently must (1) file a written application and all degree plans prior to completing the last 15 hours of the first degree; (2) fulfill all specific major, minor, and college degree requirements in force at the time of his initial enrollment, and (3) successfully complete 30 hours in each of the majors here at OHC. A minimum of 158 cumulative semester hours is required to earn two bachelor’s degrees.

## Final Examinations

In order to complete the semester, each student must take final examinations as scheduled.

It is the student’s responsibility to arrange travel in a manner that will not interfere with the examination schedule. Requests for modification for a student’s final examination schedule, because of unforeseen emergencies, must be arranged through the Academic Affairs Committee. A form may be obtained from the Registrar’s Office.

## Graduation Contract

All graduates are expected to participate in the commencement exercises unless given permission by the Academic Affairs Committee to graduate in absentia.

## Deferred Graduation

Students ordinarily graduate under the requirements of the catalog of the year in which they enter OHC. Students who are studying for a baccalaureate degree and fail to graduate within six calendar years (four years for an associate degree), must conform to the current catalog. Students who have not attended for more than one calendar year must conform to the current catalog at the time of re-entry.

Seniors must file an application for graduation at the fall registration of their senior year. Previous to their senior year students should check periodically with the Registrar’s Office to determine whether they are meeting all curriculum requirements satisfactorily.

## Privacy of Student Records

Personally identifiable information, including grade reports, will not be released to parents/guardians of single students unless a student specifically requests in writing that this be done. Federal guidelines also allow the college to share academic information with college personnel and other institutions that may have legitimate educational interest in this information. Students have the right to inspect and review their academic records as kept by the college.

## Absences

Attendance at class and laboratory appointments is expected. Teachers prepare an absence policy for each class, which includes an explanation of penalties, if any, for absences, and the procedure for making up work, if such is allowed. It is the responsibility of teachers to publish their policies for each class at the beginning of each semester, but it is the students’ responsibility to familiarize themselves with the practices of each teacher from whom they are taking classes.

## Late Work

Prompt and punctual completion of all homework and classwork is expected. Teachers prepare a policy for late work for each class, which includes an explanation of penalties, if any, for late work, and the procedure for making up work, if such is allowed. It is the responsibility of teachers to publish their policies for each class at the beginning of each semester, but it is the students’ responsibility to familiarize themselves with the practices of each teacher from whom they are taking classes.

## Photo Release

By registering at Ouachita Hills College, students authorize the use and reproduction by OHC or anyone authorized by OHC, of any pictorial images (including conventional, video, and digital photography) taken of them while enrolled at Ouachita Hills College, without compensation. All negatives, positives, and prints shall constitute Ouachita Hills College property, solely and completely.

## Standards of Conduct

In harmony with the objectives of the college, high standards of behavior are maintained to encourage the development of genuine Christian character. Mature Christian students of sound spiritual and social integrity appreciate standards that elevate and ennoble. Admission to Ouachita Hills College is a privilege that requires the acceptance of and compliance with published and announced regulations. Only those whose principles and interests are in harmony with the ideals of the college and who willingly subscribe to the social program as ordered are welcomed.

It follows that since students at Ouachita Hills College engage actively in the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, those who engage in activities determined to be detrimental on or off campus will not be knowingly accepted or retained and may be put on conduct probation.

A student who is out of harmony with the policies of the college, who is uncooperative, and whose attitude gives evidence of an unresponsive nature may be asked to withdraw without specific charge.

Each student is expected to acquaint himself with the standards of conduct published in the Ouachita Hills College Handbook. Interim announcements of policies adopted by the administration are of equal force with those listed in the official publications.
