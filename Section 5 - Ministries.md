## Soul-Winning at OHC

OHC offers many ways to be personally involved in evangelism during the school year. Through the canvassing program, students find many people interested in understanding the Bible better. At times, students may follow up these interests by giving personal Bible studies while receiving helpful instruction from the experienced pastors and Bible workers on staff at OHC.

Many students have the opportunity to work with neighboring churches by preaching, giving Bible studies, and working with the local youth. Students are active in local churches with both English- and Spanish-speaking congregations. Our church involvement includes pre-work for evangelism and church planting.

The students take an active role in evangelism pre-work throughout the country while canvassing, and nearby in door-to-door work and giving of Bible studies.

## Why Canvassing?

The program at OHC prepares students to serve the Lord at home or abroad. Every gospel worker will benefit from the experience of selling Christian literature door-to-door. “Those who give evidence that they are truly converted, and who take up the canvassing work, will see that it is the best preparation for other lines of missionary labor” (*Testimonies,* vol. 6, 330).

Evangelistic canvassing is especially valuable to those who are preparing to enter the Lord’s work as pastors and evangelists. 

> “Those who are fitting for the ministry can engage in no other work which will give them so large an experience as will the canvassing work. All who want an opportunity for true ministry, and who will give themselves unreservedly to the Lord, will find in the canvassing work opportunities to speak upon many things that pertain to the future immortal life” (*Review and Herald,* November 7, 1899).

For these reasons, canvassing is not just an extracurricular activity. All students are required to spend at least ten weeks total in a canvassing program, either during one summer or one academic school year, prior to graduation. Those choosing a deeper level of involvement may find that they can graduate nearly debt-free.

## Medical Missionary Training

We believe Christ has called His disciples to completely restore the image of God in man—soul, body and spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:23). For this reason, “every gospel worker should feel that to teach the principles of healthful living is a part of his appointed work” Evangelism, 526.

Because medical missionary work is the “right, helping hand of the gospel, to open doors for the proclamation of the message” (Evangelism, 526), it is our goal to enable students to incorporate health evangelism into their ministry.

While we do not offer a degree in health education at this time, health courses are offered. Further training is provided through active outreach in the community by conducting various health evangelism programs (Cooking Schools, Stress Seminars, Natural Healing Seminars).

## Mission Trip Participation

OHC provides an opportunity each year during the winter break for students to participate in a mission trip. Because we believe this is an important opportunity, students participating in the Canvassing or Bible Work Scholarship Programs would be exempt from the Winter L.E./Bible Work Program once during their college education without having to meet the required $5,000 to register for the spring semester. This exemption would be allowed after the student has been in attendance for at least one full year.

## Community Service Day

Each semester, the faculty and students of OHC have the opportunity to serve the surrounding communities in a special way. Once a semester, a Community Service Day is arranged. This is a time when the students are sent into the community to help various families and other organizations. Some students help the elderly with yard work or housework, while other students work to beautify the community in other ways. Each Community Service Day is eagerly anticipated by staff and students alike.

## Churches

Students are assigned to the various churches based on talents, church needs, skills, and other factors. The students have opportunities to minister to the churches and their home communities through active involvement in the services and outreach plans of each church. 

## Prison Ministries

The Ouachita River Correctional Institution is located about an hour’s drive from the campus and a few minutes from the Malvern SDA Church. Several church members at Malvern have started visiting the prisoners there every Sabbath and love for the OHC students to be a part of this special ministry. 

To participate in the prison ministry team, the student must:

* be at least 18 years of age
* have a valid form of identification (driver’s license, passport, etc.)
* pass the state background check
