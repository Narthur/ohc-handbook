# Student Life
## Introduction

Ouachita Hills College, as a Seventh-day Adventist institution of higher learning, desires to maintain high Christian standards of integrity, courtesy, dedication, and accomplishment. In order to achieve this ideal, the spiritual devotion as well as the lifestyle and academic achievements of each student should be consistent with Scriptural principles. All should be done “heartily as to the Lord, and not unto men, knowing that of the Lord, ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve the Lord Christ” (Colossians 3:23–24).

OHC has established guidelines and principles to promote harmony and order. OHC believes these principles reflect the love and holiness of the God we serve.

## Dress

> “No education can be complete that does not teach right principles in regard to dress. Without such teaching, the work of education is too often retarded or perverted” (*Education,* 246).

OHC's dress standards are based on the principle that what a person wears influences as well as reflects his heart. OHC desires that each student and staff member dress in such a way as to reflect the righteousness of Christ. Clothing should therefore be neat, clean, modest, and appropriate on or off campus. For “a person’s character is judged by his style of dress. In dress, as in all things, it is our privilege to honor our Creator” (*Education,* 248). 

### General Guidelines

**Designs & Logos:** Choose the best when wearing T-shirts with designs or logos. Wear only those bearing slogans that are consistent with our high and holy calling as Seventh-day Adventist Christians.

**Undershirts:** Undershirts are not appropriate to wear in public. If worn under a shirt, please keep the outer shirt buttoned.

**Etcetera:** Necklaces, rings, arm/leg bracelets, leather or string bands, earrings and similar kinds of jewelry and decorations are not to be worn. Colorful cosmetics and nail polish are not to be used. Hair should be its natural color.

### Guidelines for Men

**Church Attire:** Men should wear dress or khaki type slacks, lapel-collared shirts and ties, or turtle necks. Suits are strongly recommended.

**Classroom & Ministry Attire:** Men should wear dress or khaki type slacks, lapel-collared shirts, non-collared dress shirts, or sweaters. All pants need to fit the waist with no more than a one-inch excess. They should not be baggy or have long crotches. Shirts with front buttons should be worn buttoned to within one button of the collar.

**Recreational Attire:** Whether a student is in the residence hall or relaxing outdoors, he should follow heavenly principles that will please God and help other students avoid temptation through what they see others wearing. For further insight, see *Messages to Young People,* 345–360.

### Guidelines for Women

**Church Attire:** Please wear nice Sabbath clothes and dress shoes. These should not be the same clothes that students wear to class. Wear your best for the King of kings and Lord of lords.

**Classroom & Ministry Attire:** Dresses and skirts must be long enough to cover the knee when standing or sitting. Slits should begin below the bottom of the knee (regardless of whether the slit is on the side, back, or front), and should be sewn to that point, not pinned. Skirts should be loose enough to be able to turn around the body easily.

**Recreational Attire:** Whether a student is in the residence hall or relaxing outdoors, she should follow heavenly principles that will please God and help other students avoid temptation through what they see others wearing. For further insight, see *Messages to Young People,* 345–360. In most instances, skirts, dresses, and culottes are most desirable. These must be long enough to cover the knee when standing or sitting. For activities where a skirt would be immodest or provide inadequate leg protection, feminine style (non-jean style) slacks and long blouses are appropriate.

> “True education does not ignore the value of scientific knowledge or literary acquirements, but above information, it values power; above power, goodness; above intellectual acquirements, character”  (*Education*, 225).

## Social Relationships

Ouachita Hills College fosters an atmosphere where social relationships are modest and honorable. We also maintain that God has a “time for everything,” including relationships with the opposite sex. Ellen White addressed this timing in Fundamentals of Christian Education, 62: “When a conference selects young men and women, and aids them in obtaining an education for the canvassing field or any other branch of the work, there should be an understanding as to what they propose to do, whether they design to engage in courtship and marriage, or to labor for the advancement of the cause of truth. It is no use to spend time and money in the education of workers who will fall in love before they complete their education.”

She was also given counsel regarding courtship in school in order to guide our colleges at Battle Creek and Avondale. When her son asked her about the validity of making general applications of these statements, she responded with the counsel found in Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 101: “In all our dealings with students, age and character must be taken into account. We cannot treat the young and old just alike. There are circumstances under which men and women of sound experience and good standing may be granted some privileges not given to the younger students. The age, the conditions and the turn of the mind must be taken into consideration. We must be wisely considerate in our work. But we must not lessen our firmness and vigilance in dealing with students of all ages, nor our strictness in forbidding the unprofitable and unwise association of young and immature students.”

However, while some privileges may be given to older men and women, it is still not wise to attempt to complete a college education and to court at the same time, since both deserve sober and earnest attention. We strongly recommend that older students also “make haste slowly” while studying at OHC in order to prepare themselves as gospel workers in the world church. 

OHC encourages the building of strong friendships between all of its students, but, because we want to help you best prepare for your future in God’s service as well as your future married life, we do not permit dating/courting. Older students with life experience in ministry may be granted permission to continue their studies while engaged in courtship. 

In addition to this policy, a few practical rules have been adopted:

In general, a young man and woman should not spend time alone either on or off campus, including traveling to or from school. We understand that some exceptions may arise in which a young man and woman may be together unchaperoned, but as the Bible says, “avoid the appearance of evil” (1 Thessalonians 5:22). 

Except as noted above, students who are already dating or courting before arriving on campus are expected to put their relationship on hold while studying here.

## Music Guidelines

“Music was made to serve a holy purpose, to lift the thoughts to that which is pure, noble and elevating, and to awaken in the soul devotion and gratitude to God” Patriarchs and Prophets, 594. In the area of music, as in every other facet of Christian living, our desire is to reach God’s ideal rather than settle for what the world offers or what makes us feel good. As you walk through the dormitory halls, we want you to be uplifted to “heavenly places” by the music that you hear. 

We realize that we are all still growing in Christ and we may not all share the same views upon what it means to make a “melody in your heart to the Lord” Ephesians 5:19. Therefore, we ask that you show respect to those around you by refraining from playing any music that could possibly offend the consciences of other students or staff members. If there are differences in musical tastes between you and your roommate, please use earphones when listening to music. 

Our minimum requirements regarding music include the following:

Please do not bring rock, rap, jazz, rhythm and blues, or contemporary Christian music on campus. These musical forms feature the kinds of rhythms that were specifically designed for the drum set and result in negatively altering our concept of the holiness of God, as well as in increased sensuality. For these reasons, music accompanied by the drum set, which includes but is not limited to the styles already mentioned, should be avoided.

In the case of question or controversy concerning what is acceptable, the final decision will be made by the OHC Administrative Committee. 

To guide you as you continue your study of Christian music, we recommend these resources:

* The Christian and Rock Music by Samuele Bacchiocchi 
* Notes on Music by Louis and Carol Torres 
* The official guidelines of the Seventh-day Adventist church as drafted during the Autumn Council of the General Conference in October 2004. This can be found at the following site: http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/music-guidelines.html

Also prepare for the joy of learning Scripture songs while at Ouachita Hills College. They can be a power in your life as you seek to hide God’s Word in your heart (see Psalm 119:11). 

## Health Principles

“What, know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?” 1 Corinthians 6:19. 

“Youth who are kept in school and confined to close study, can not have sound health. The lesson must be often repeated, and pressed home to the conscience, that education will be of little value if there is no physical strength to use it after it is gained. Students should not be permitted to take so many studies that they will have no time for physical training. The health can not be preserved unless some portion of each day is given to muscular exertion in the open air. Stated hours should be devoted to manual labor of some kind,— anything which will call into action all parts of the body. When students leave college, they should have better health and a better understanding of the laws of life than when they entered it. The health should be as sacredly guarded as the character” The Advocate, March 3, 1900. 

Ouachita Hills College believes that we should practice and teach health principles to glorify God. For this reason, we try to incorporate physical exercise through manual labor as part of the daily schedule; however, we encourage students to pursue their own personal exercise programs as well. Opportunities in landscaping, gardening, food service, construction, and other forms of vocational training provide a healthful break from study and teach necessary skills that will be of great benefit in mission service. 

The use of alcoholic beverages, illegal drugs, tobacco products, and the abuse of prescription drugs are forbidden on or off campus. Violation of this policy will be dealt with immediately by the administration. 

The practice of health principles also includes our diet. It is part of the education at OHC to learn to enjoy a total vegetarian cuisine. Although a student kitchen is available in each residence hall, students are encouraged to eat the majority of their meals during regular mealtimes in the cafeteria. 

Three meals are served daily in the dining hall. At registration students will be given a schedule detailing the hours that the cafeteria will serve these meals. 

Students who wish to follow a two-meal-a-day plan are free to skip the last meal of the day. Students are strongly encouraged to eat a good breakfast daily. 

## Medical Care

Illness or accidents that result in injury should be reported immediately to the men’s or women’s dean. The dean will determine the seriousness of the injury/illness and whether professional medical help should be obtained. The dean may also issue the sick student an excuse from classes, work, and/or worships until the student is well again, if applicable.

## Sabbath Observance

“The value of the Sabbath as a means of education is beyond estimate. Since the Sabbath is a memorial of creative power, it is the day above all others when we should acquaint ourselves with God through His works” Education, 250-251. 

Students and faculty worship the Creator every Sabbath in fellowship with believers at one of the many Seventh-day Adventist churches in the area. In this way, students may be a blessing to a local congregation and put into practice the principles and skills they are learning in evangelism. Many students use Sabbath afternoon for outreach activities such as visiting missing members, giving Bible studies, working with youth groups, and conducting programs at various churches. There are ample opportunities for service during these sacred hours. 

We ask that all students plan their week so as to be ready in plenty of time for the opening of the Sabbath. Rooms should be clean, clothing prepared, showers taken, and hearts softened and subdued before the sun approaches the horizon. 

We meet together, as a college body, to welcome the Sabbath. The timing and location of these meetings varies with the timing of the sunset. Students are responsible to note the announced scheduled time and location for our Welcome Sabbath meetings. 

## Residence Hall Policies

Men are not to be in the ladies’ living quarters or women in the men’s living quarters at any time except as part of a staff-sponsored, dean-approved activity.

Student rooms are to be kept in a neat and orderly fashion. Residence-hall deans and assistants will periodically check the order of rooms, especially in preparation for the Sabbath. 

All eating is to be done in the kitchen and dining room areas.

It is the responsibility of every student and staff member to keep the college and its premises neat and clean. Students should not leave books, clothing and other personal items in any public room of the residence halls. 

Every Friday, the dormitories and all other rooms of the college will have a special Sabbath cleaning. All students will work together to prepare the building and grounds for God’s holy Sabbath. 

Television and video viewing is not permitted in the residence halls although students may watch any of the educational videos found in the OHC library. Nothing of a theatrical nature is permitted.

Internet access is available for student use in the administration building. The computers in the offices are reserved for school business only. 

The public rooms of the residence halls will be closed at 9:30 each evening. We encourage all students and staff to get adequate sleep by following this counsel: “In regulating the hours for sleep, there should be no haphazard work. Students should not form the habit of burning the midnight oil and taking the hours of the day for sleep. If they have been accustomed to doing this at home, they should correct the habit, going to bed at a seasonable hour. They will then rise in the morning, refreshed for the duties of the day. In our schools, the lights should be put out at half past nine” Counsels to Parents, Teachers and Students, 297. Students should be in their respective dormitory rooms at 9:30 pm Sunday-Friday and at 10:00 pm on Saturday. At this time, all main rooms in the residence hall, such as the living room and kitchen, will be closed and the doors to the dormitories locked.

## Housing Policy

Each student is responsible for the cost of any damages occurring within his or her housing space. Each student is responsible for the furnishings assigned to him/her and the cost to replace/repair any damaged furnishings. No student may make any changes in the residence hall or housing, including but not limited to the moving of furniture, without proper authorization.

No televisions, microwave ovens, or mini refrigerators are needed. Each residence hall is equipped with a full kitchen, including stove, oven, microwave, freezer, and refrigerator. 

Other items to leave at home are:

* waterbeds and water-filled furniture
* candles and incense burners
* hot plates
* air conditioning units
* TV or radio antennas
* satellite dishes

OHC is not liable in any way for theft, damage, or loss of money, valuables, or any other personal property belonging to a student for any reason whatsoever. When preparing to leave on canvassing programs or any other event, it is advised that students pack up and remove all valuables from their rooms. 

At the end of each semester, each student must clean his/her room thoroughly and pack up all belongings to be stored in the attic of the residence hall. The student is not free to leave until the dean or residence hall assistant has checked the student’s room and given approval.

Mail service is provided through the college addresses.

When sending or receiving letters, please use the post office address:

c/o Ouachita Hills College
PO Box 170
Amity, AR 71921

When sending or receiving packages, use the street address:

c/o Ouachita Hills College
46 Madison Way
Amity, AR 71921

## Pets and Animals

The staff at OHC understand the love and care of God’s creatures. However, the only pets students may bring to school are fish. Please notify administration prior to your arrival if you are bringing your fish. 

Occasionally stray animals appear on campus. If you notice a stray animal, notify the office and resist the desire to feed the animal.

For your safety, please familiarize yourself with all tornado and fire escape plans for each building, as they may differ from building to building.

## Care of Residence Halls

God has placed humanity as stewards of His gifts. There are many ways to practice energy conservation in the dorms and other buildings. Turning off lights when they are not needed, using water carefully, and keeping windows closed when the heat or air conditioning units are in use will greatly help in conserving both energy and finances.

## What to Bring with You

Each room at OHC is supplied with:

* a twin bed
* mattress
* dresser
* desk
* chair 

Please bring:

* towels
* washcloths
* sheets
* blankets
* pillow 
* bedding and linens

Students may want to bring extra shelving with them for books and other personal items. 

OHC is located in the southern United States, but still experiences a cool autumn and a cold winter even though snow is minimal. As you pack, include warm clothing (i.e. winter coat and gloves) and bedding. 

## Worship Attendance

Students are expected to be personally responsible for attendance at all scheduled meetings, including morning and evening worships and college meetings.  Attendance is taken at each meeting. Students are permitted to miss up to three (3) meetings per semester without a penalty. 

Times for general meetings/worships:

|Morning worship |6:45 a.m. weekdays; 7:30 a.m. weekends
|Evening worship |7:00 p.m. Sunday–Tuesday, Thursday
|Prayer Meeting  |6:45 p.m. Wednesday
|Assembly        |7:45 a.m. Wednesday
|Vespers         |7:00 p.m. Friday
|College Meeting |10:50 a.m. Sunday

Any other meetings will be announced with their times

## Internal Discipline Policy

Students may be absent from or tardy to three religious meetings per semester without repercussions of any type.

When students are out of state or at a significant distance from campus, whether for funerals, marriages, ministry, or an otherwise approved activity, absences will not be counted towards the three allotted to responsible students.

When students are sick enough that they would willingly miss classes and meals their deans should be alerted prior to worship. Absences by students noted by deans as being this ill may be excused.

Students on administrative assignments or otherwise required to be away from religious meetings by Ouachita Hills staff will not be counted as being absent or tardy.

## External Discipline Policy

Students who exceed their three granted absences/tardies will be scheduled to meet with a group of OHC staff to discuss the lack of attendance and together design a corrective plan of action.

## Definitions

An absence will be defined as either failing to attend a religious meeting or arriving seven or more minutes after the scheduled time for the meeting to begin.

A tardy will be defined as attending a religious meeting but arriving between 1 and 7 minutes after the scheduled time for the meeting to begin.

A religious meeting in this policy means:

* morning worship
* evening worship
* prayer meeting
* assembly
* vespers
* college meeting

## Student Council

The purpose of the Student Council is to provide a venue for students to give recommendations for improvements or opportunities for service.

The Student Council is made of a total of nine students—one representative from each of the five degree programs offered as well as one representative from each class. The Council meets at least once a month to discuss any improvements that might be made to the campus or programs and new opportunities for service. The Council is accountable to two staff members in case of any questions. Staff members will evaluate all recommendations and choose council members. Council members are expected to show godly leadership skills and a mission-oriented mindset, to be in good standing with classroom responsibilities (including homework completion), and to be punctual for all events.

## Disciplinary Procedures

The Administrative Committee of OHC is responsible to see that all of the student life policies are maintained. When students disregard these policies, the Committee will advise and discipline as it deems necessary. The administration also reserves the right, without parental consent, to perform any of the following measures:

* Question a student regarding his or her behavior on or off campus. 
* Inspect a student’s room. 
* Inspect a student’s car (with the student present). 
* Arrange for the conducting of alcohol and drug testing. 
* Require counseling, education or treatment programs as necessary. 
* Ask a student to withdraw from school if at any time the student’s conduct, influence, or attitude is not in harmony with the philosophy and guidelines of the college and that student is not willing to change his or her behavior.

## Entertainment

We believe in upholding the principle found in 1 Corinthians 10:31, “... whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” While nothing of the world’s style of entertainment has a place in the life of a follower of Christ, there are many beneficial forms of recreation which students are encouraged to participate in.

“There are modes of recreation which are highly beneficial to both mind and body. An enlightened, discriminating mind will find abundant means for entertainment and diversion, from sources not only innocent, but instructive. Recreation in the open air, the contemplation of the works of God in nature, will be of the highest benefit” Christian Education, pg. 35.

## Hunting Season

Life in the country includes an annual hunting season. During hunting season, anyone walking or biking off campus must wear a bright orange jacket for safety. An orange hat is helpful as well. The bright orange makes it obvious to hunters that you are not the creature they are hunting! 

## Grievance Policy

“Where no counsel is, the people fall, but in a multitude of counselors, there is safety.” We support and uplift one another, therefore we value the views and concerns of every member of our family. Matters of serious concern will be thoroughly evaluated, to the ends that a biblically-supported plan of execution may be discovered.  

The purpose of the grievance procedure is to provide a process for a review. An action that qualifies for the grievance procedure is one that: 

* Is in violation of written campus policies or procedures OR 
* Constitutes arbitrary, capricious, or unequal application of written campus policies or procedures. 

Any student who believes he/she has grounds for a grievance shall make an attempt in good faith to resolve the problem through written communication, or discussion with the student or staff member directly involved. If a resolution of the problem is not achieved through the informal procedure, the student may request further evaluation of a concern by submitting a completed grievance form to the Ouachita Hills College president. Any grievance reports must be received in writing by the president no later than 21 calendar days after the student first becomes aware of the facts which gave rise to the grievance. All written grievances will be evaluated within 14 working days of the report’s reception by the president.

Any submitted Student Grievance Form (located in the Registrar’s Office) will be reviewed by the appropriate committee (the Academic or the Administrative Committee). This committee will make a final determination. If the grievance is not found to exert an injurious effect, the matter will be closed and those involved will be notified of the reason(s) for closure.

## Electronic Devices

During registration, all students must register all electronic devices that connect to the internet. Each student will be given an account on the school network in order to access the internet from their device or from the school computers. The use of this network is a privilege. Please keep in mind a few general things:

“When Jesus possesses the heart, there will be no prevarication, no secret iniquity practiced, no hidden sins covered; all will be as transparent as the sunlight” Sabbath School Worker, Oct. 1, 1885 par. 10. Be careful when using, copying, or downloading anything from the internet or sharing copyrighted material. For a closer look at copyright laws, visit http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/intellectual-property/copyrights/.

Academy students have stricter internet regulations than college students do. Do not share your passwords or information with anyone else. Do not share any electronic device with an academy student, including, but not limited to, computers, phones, or iPods.

You are responsible for all information or use of resources entrusted to you and will therefore be held accountable for the use made of each.

Certain websites are blocked either because of content or (as in the case of YouTube) because of bandwidth.

Respect the privacy and personal rights of fellow students and staff members. Again, do not try to guess another’s password or try to access someone else’s account without authorization. Be professional and respectful when communicating and avoid slander, etc.

Violations will be dealt with by the Administrative Committee and may result in the loss of internet privileges. Individuals are also subject to all federal, state, and local laws that may apply.

## Special Events
### College Retreat

At the beginning of each semester college students and staff get together for a spiritual retreat. It is a time to fellowship, network and get to know one another as we begin a new year/semester.

### Faculty Home Vespers

Once a semester, faculty members hold vespers services in their homes. Students will be assigned to a staff home prior to that vespers.

### Weeks Of Prayer

Every semester, the staff and students at Ouachita Hills are privileged to enjoy a Week of Prayer. The Week of Prayer during the fall semester is presented by students. During the spring semester, the messages are presented by a guest speaker. The normal schedule will be shifted slightly to accommodate the extra meetings. Be prepared for a spiritual feast each time!

### Courtesy Week

“The essence of true politeness is consideration for others... The Bible enjoins courtesy, and it presents many illustrations of the unselfish spirit, the gentle grace, the winsome temper, that characterize true politeness. These are but reflections of the character of Christ. All the real tenderness and courtesy in the world, even among those who do not acknowledge His name, is from Him. And He desires these characteristics to be perfectly reflected in His children. It is His purpose that in us men shall behold His beauty” Education, pg. 241-242. 

At Ouachita Hills College, students and staff are learning to reflect the courtesy of Christ. Each year, one week is set aside during the spring semester as a special courtesy emphasis week. The focus during that week is on learning and practicing the finer details of Christian courtesy. The rest of the school year we continue practicing!

### College Days

Every fall, potential students and their families join us for a taste of life here at OHC. The visiting young people will be housed in the residence halls and will shadow the current students for a weekend.

During events such as week of prayer, we often have a closed weekend. This simply means that in order for all the students and faculty to enjoy the maximum spiritual benefit of the messages, no visitors are allowed and no student is allowed to leave campus for that weekend.

## Bookstore Information

Because we want to encourage you to build a library of Spirit of Prophecy books, the bookstore will not accept any of Ellen White’s books back after you have purchased them. For a list of required books by class, please contact the Registrar’s Office. 

## Library Policies

All books checked out from the Ouachita Hills library must be returned within three (3) weeks. Fees will be charged for late and/or damaged books.

## Office Policies

Office areas are to be used exclusively for work and related activities.
