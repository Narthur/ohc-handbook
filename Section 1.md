# General Information
## Ouachita Hills College
There are many things to consider when choosing further education. Career advancement, job satisfaction, influence, and salary are often contemplated. Indeed, these are important considerations. Should they, however, be the primary reasons for receiving a college education?

The decision to go to college should not be made without taking eternity into consideration. “True education means more than the perusal of a certain course of study. It means more than a preparation for the life that now is. It has to do with the whole being and with the whole period of existence possible to man….It prepares the student for the joy of service in this world and for the higher joy of wider service in the world to come.” Education, 13. The benefits are twofold, for “no man can lay up treasure in heaven without finding his life on earth thereby enriched and ennobled.” Education, 145.

Martin Luther once said, “Every institution in which men are not unceasingly occupied with the Word of God must become corrupt.” At Ouachita Hills College our goal is for students, while preparing for their life work, to be immersed in the Word of God and to enjoy a more vibrant walk with their Savior.

“The heaven-appointed purpose of giving the gospel to the world in this generation is the noblest that can appeal to any human being.” Education, 262. At Ouachita Hills College, each student, regardless of his major, receives a thorough training, not only in the Word of God, but also in the science of soul-winning. Whatever our profession, soul winning is our calling.

What is the benefit of having a core curriculum in which each student deeply studies the Word of God and also develops soul-winning skills? Sharing the end-time truth with others helps to solidify the truth in our own minds, establishes the beauty and veracity of the Word of God, and especially confirms in our own hearts the Adventist message. Learning how to meet objections and to give biblical answers is wonderful preparation for a life of rewarding witnessing. Ouachita Hills College graduates, by God’s grace, will be rightly trained to use their God-given gifts to win souls for the Master, regardless of their chosen career or vocation.

## Mission Statement

The family of OHC, while striving for moral excellence, is conscious of its limitations. The faculty aims to prepare a class of students that will one day surpass their teachers in their qualifications for ministry.

Our college has been given a focus. “Success in any line demands a definite aim. He who would achieve true success in life must keep steadily in view the aim worthy of his endeavor. Such an aim is set before the youth of today. The heaven-appointed purpose of taking the gospel to the world in this generation is the noblest that can appeal to any human being” Education, 262. This is our goal.
