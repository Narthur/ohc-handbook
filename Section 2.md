## Non-Discriminatory Policy

Ouachita Hills College admits students of any race or color, national or ethnic origin, and seeks to provide them with all of the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded to students at the school. No discrimination in the administration of educational policies, scholarships, vocational training, extracurricular activities, or other school-administered programs is allowed.

## Admission of Homeschooled Students

Homeschooled students need to meet all General Admissions Requirements.

## Admission of Transfer Students

Students transferring from other recognized colleges or universities must have a miminum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. Students transferring to OHC with fewer than 24 semester credits (or 36 quarter credits) will be considered for admission on the basis of a combination of scores from their secondary school records and previous college work.

## Admission Status Clarification

Provisional Status is a temporary admission that may be assigned by the Admissions Committee to a student who has submitted evidence of fulfilling all academic requirements but is in the process of completing his or her admissions file. Provisional Status is a conditional acceptance which is limited to two semesters.

* A student’s provisional status remains in effect until all official papers are received by OHC or until the conditional time period is concluded.
* Acceptance will be withdrawn at the end of the conditional time period if admission requirements remain unmet.
* An unconditional acceptance will be granted when all admission requirements are met (official papers are received).
* Ouachita Hills College will not issue transcripts or grade reports to a student who is on conditional acceptance status, even if the student’s account is paid in full. Ouachita Hills College will not issue a transcript for any student (current or past) who is missing official transcripts.

Academic Probation Status is an admission status that may be assigned by the Admissions Committee to a student who has a below minimum GPA or ACT/SAT score. A student on Academic Probation Status may only take up to 12 hours until he has a current GPA of at least 2.0. Academic Probation Status will automatically be removed when a student has maintained a GPA of at least 2.5 for one semester.

## Procedure to Apply for Admission

The Admissions Committee considers an applicant as soon as his application file is complete. A complete application will include the following:

* A completed application form (may be completed and submitted on-line: www.ohc.org)
* Three references – submitted directly by teacher, pastor, and employer (may be completed and submitted on-line: www.ohc.org)
* Official secondary school transcript or GED (Note: this is waived if the student has earned an associate or higher degree from a recognized college or university).
* Official transcripts from each college or university attended. Official transcripts are those issued and sealed by the school, college, or university and received by OHC in a sealed envelope. If the seal of the envelope is broken before reaching the admissions office, it is not considered to be an official transcript. Notarized or certified true-copy-of-original certificates or educational documents issued by a non-U.S. institution may be accepted. If the document is in a language other than English, a certified translation into English must be provided.
* SAT or ACT scores.
•	English Test scores (TOEFL or Michigan Test of English or ACT) and a summary of the student’s educational background if the student is from a non-English speaking country.
* Mail all application materials with a $25 check application fee (application fee is waived if application is submitted online) to the address on the front cover. All materials submitted become the property of OHC and cannot be returned or forwarded to another institution.

## Returning Students

Former OHC students wishing to return to OHC must reapply for admission. Former students are those who have not been in attendance for one or more semesters.

## Vocational Training

Students are required, as part of the curriculum, to participate in practical training each semester. During registration at the beginning of each semester, each student will be given a vocational assignment. These vocational assignments include, but are not limited to, agriculture, construction, kitchen/bakery, office, and media work. Students should bring clothing appropriate for such jobs. Closed-toe shoes are required for certain jobs.
