# Religion Department

The religion department of Ouachita Hills College exists to assist every student in 
developing a well-rounded, functional, and personal relationship with the Creator God as 
revealed in Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy, and to equip them to take up their 
individually specific roles in the mission of His church to the world. In pursuit of 
these overall objectives the department seeks to achieve each of the following four core 
goals.

## Spiritual Growth

Lead each student to a more personal, dynamic, and saving relationship with the Creator God of Heaven, and to a
personal commitment to participate in His mission.

## Academic Knowledge

Equip each student with a solid functional understanding of both Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy counsels
provided by God through Ellen G. White, while at the same time equipping them with the understanding of
other current, relevant, supporting, and contrasting information which serves to provide a further and deeper
understanding of these counsels.

## Contextual Knowledge

Provide each student with a clear and complete working understanding of Christ’s church, its mission in history, as
well as its current condition and mission today. Also to provide each student with an understanding of how he/she,
as an individual, can fit into the role and mission of His church.

## Functional Preparedness

Prepare students for their unique contribution to the world-wide mission of the church by assisting them in
assessing and developing their personal aptitudes, skills, and abilities through the use of traditional style didactic
learning methods, as well as the provision of numerous opportunities to practice and develop these skills.

# Business Department

The Christian Business Management Program offers the opportunity for students to gain a broad set of skills in business
administration and leadership. Students learn the principles that will equip them to work in both for-profit and non-profit
organizations. This program has a strong emphasis on Christian business principles that prepares the students to be
witnesses for Christ in the work place.

The instructors are experienced business professionals who understand the fundamentals of business administration and
stay current with new ideas and principles. The instructors’ passion is to educate students to do everything both to serve
the Lord and to strive for excellence. This program is designed for students who would like to be fully equipped to serve
the Lord and pursue a career in the church, in a supporting ministry, or in the business world.

environment.

communication skills.
